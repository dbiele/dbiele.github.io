**Course Name:**  
SCJohnson Lean Overview

**Description:**  
S.C. Johnson had been providing classroom-led training programs.  The course is a part of SCJ’s Global Excellence program offered to employees globally.  The program had included instructor-led courses and on-the-job application activities. Due to budget cuts, SC Johnson was unable to offer this course on a consistent basis.  Additionally, there is increased demand globally for courses for managers.  Again, this course is a small part of SCJohnson online learning that I built for them.  This is a good example of gamification.

**Audience:**  
•	The audience for this courses is production employees.  Other courses varied in learning audiences from display stocking to finance.  
•	The audience for this course will be entry-level employees as well as managers.  
•	Global audience for some courses.  
•	Courses may be viewed as part of the Global Excellence Program, but may also be reviewed as reference materials for a quick refresher.
•	This is considered an “internal audience”.   
•	The courses are intended for a global audience where English may be a second language.
