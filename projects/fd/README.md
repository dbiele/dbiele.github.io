SCJohnson Lean Overview

**Description:**  
S.C. Johnson had been providing classroom-led training programs.  The course is a part of SCJ’s Global Excellence program offered to employees globally.  The program had included instructor-led courses and on-the-job application activities. Due to budget cuts, SC Johnson was unable to offer this course on a consistent basis.  Additionally, there is increased demand globally for courses for managers.  This course is a small part of SCJohnson online learning that I built for them.  This is a good example of gamification.

- Courses may be viewed as part of the Global Excellence Program, but may also be reviewed as reference material for a quick refresher.
- This is considered an “internal audience”.   
- The courses are intended for a global audience where English may be a second language.
